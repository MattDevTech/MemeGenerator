The hardest part of this was definitely the CSS I spent hours stuck trying to get the text divs to properly line up on the image div. CSS is my weakest point and so I struggled with positioning relative/absolute. Ultimately I was listening to a CSS video while walking my dog and the speaker mentioned that in order for position: absolute to work correctly you have to give the parent element a relative position. Otherwise the child element will position itself absolutely based on the first parent element it can find that has a position: relative(even if it has to go up to the HTML tag). Once I had that down the rest went pretty smoothly but I was very burnt out on this assessment. At nearly 7 hours I'm submitting it and hoping to move on. It certainly could look better and it has shown me that I have to work on my CSS as it is clearly a huge weak spot for me.
